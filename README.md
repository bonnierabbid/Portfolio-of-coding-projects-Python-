**Exercise 3: Temperature Converter**

**Description of the code：**
The code is encapsulated in the main() function. Firstly, after getting the user's input for Celsius or Fahrenheit, it is capitalised to maintain unity.
Then, the user's temperature input is put into a while loop, and the if statement and the corresponding temperature interval are used as conditions to determine whether the user's temperature input is reasonable or not, until the user enters the appropriate temperature and exits the loop.
Finally, the result is calculated and outputted by a known formula.

**Exercise 7: Password Checker**

**Description of the code：**
In the finished program, a main() function is created to process the user input, run the verification and print the result of the password detection.
In the main function, the Boolean variable is initialised first as a judge of whether the password condition is met or not. Secondly, a while loop is used as the main structure to ensure compliance with the user's password by continuously asking the user to enter the password until it passes all the tests.
In the while loop, an if statement is used to make a correct judgement and a for loop is used to detect each character in the string to ensure complete detection. Errors for each condition are printed to give feedback to the user. Failed passwords cause the condition to initialise, and the loop continues.

**Exercise 9: Simple Quiz Game**

**Description of the code：**
The code is encapsulated in main(). For each question, questions and options are printed, and after getting the user's input, spaces are removed and converted to uppercase string for easy recognition of the answer. A for loop is used to detect each character in the user's answer, and points are deducted for missing answers by the length of the difficulty.

**Exercise 10: File Reader and Writer**

**Description of the code：**
All functions are directly encapsulated in a main() function, which uses a while loop to maintain the menu loop, and the user decides when to exit.
The user's choices are judged by if statements in the loop, and three different modes, r, a, and w, are used to handle the different choices made by the user.
